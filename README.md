### Project Overview

The aim of this project is to see what valuable insights can be gained from the library database. I seek to identify trends that can be used to help improve the library's operations.

### Data sources

For the purpose of this project, my main source of data is an online library database that I accessed for analysis.

## Tools

- Microsoft SQL Server

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA used to answer the following key questions:

- What is the most borrowed book?
- What was the most popular renting month for 2023 and then for 2024?
- What member borrowed the most books?
- How many genres are there per author?
- What is the most popular genre?
- What is the number of active vs inactive library memberships?
- How many books are there per genre?
- What is the total number of books per author?

## SQL scripts written to gain insights

```sql
-- Most borrowed book --

SELECT bw.book_id,
       b.title,
       COUNT(bw.borrowing_id) AS times_borrowed
FROM borrowings AS bw
JOIN
books AS b ON bw.book_id = b.book_id
GROUP BY b.book_id
ORDER BY times_borrowed DESC
LIMIT 1;
